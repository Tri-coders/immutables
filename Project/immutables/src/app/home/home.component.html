        Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.
        
        Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
        
        OOP is faster and easier to execute.
        OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.
        OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug.
        OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
        
        Note: The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is about reducing the repetition of code. You should extract out the codes that are common for the application, and place them at a single place and reuse them instead of repeating it
